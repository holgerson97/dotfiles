# holgerson97 dotfiles - This is basically my human form configuration 

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is the pinnacle of configuration files, designed to transform your
development environment into something marginally better than chaos.

## Table of Contents

## Features
### Aerospace
Aerospace is an i3 like tiling window manager exclusively for MacOS.
The configuration features vim like bindings, working with multiple monitors
and giving a complete HotKey-based workflow for mulitple workspaces.


## Installation

Here's how you can install these masterpieces, assuming you really want to:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/holgerson97/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
Because copying random files into your home directory is always a great idea.
2. Run the Setup ScriptNavigate to the dotfiles directory and run the setup script, because nothing says "I'm ready
for anything" like executing unverified scripts.
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
Warning: May cause spontaneous enlightenment or confusion. Also there is no setup script yet.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these files, but remember: every change you make is a step further from perfection.

## Backup and Restore

Because nothing says confidence like having a backup plan:

• Backup your current dotfiles:
./backup.sh

• Restore from a backup:
./restore.sh

**Note** The backup script doesn't exist.

Or just live on the edge and skip this part.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, though I can't imagine how you'd improve upon this perfection. Open an issue or submit a
pull request if you must.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License, because originality is overrated.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the open-source community for their tools and resources, which I’ve clearly transcended with these
configurations.

Enjoy this transformative experience. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to shout them into the void
